report for junior design project class
The Set-Gi-Box is a versatile, microcontroller-based interface designed to streamline the operation and testing of SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) microscope components. The SQUID microscope is a highly sensitive instrument used for magnetic imaging, requiring the precise coordination of multiple electronic devices, such as stepper motors, power distribution units (PDUs), vacuum and temperature gauges, and data acquisition systems (DAQs). However, traditional control methods are complex and prone to inefficiencies.
To address these challenges, the Set-Gi-Box integrates and simulates various electronic components within a single, modular system. Designed with two identical printed circuit boards (PCBs), the system can emulate input and output signals to test and troubleshoot individual components, such as stepper drivers, UPS signaling, and control panels. Utilizing RS232 communication protocols, relay switching, and MOSFET-based power management, the Set-Gi-Box ensures seamless compatibility with existing scientific instrumentation.
The system’s firmware, developed in LabVIEW’s G language, enables real-time communication with the Magma Control system via VGA interfaces and custom VGA cables. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi integration allows for an intuitive user interface, enhancing accessibility and monitoring capabilities.
With its scalable and user-friendly design, the Set-Gi-Box provides industries and researchers with an efficient solution for testing and optimizing SQUID microscope components. By reducing operational complexity and improving troubleshooting processes, this project contributes to advancements in scientific instrumentation.
